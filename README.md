# House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The prediction is made using machine learning algorithms trained on a dataset of historical housing prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/house-price-prediction-seattle?resource=download]. It consists of [2017] instances and [8] features including:
Size of the house
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Location (Zip code)
etc.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn

## Usage
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
Feature engineering: extract relevant features, transform data if necessary.

## Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on the training data.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
Compare the performance of different models.

## Prediction
Make predictions on new data or test set using the best-performing model.

## Future Work
Explore additional features that could improve prediction accuracy.
Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
